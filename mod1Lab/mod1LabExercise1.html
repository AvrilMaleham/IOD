<p>This is Jack. He's an odd boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may <i> look </i> happy, but he's a <i> little </i> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>
   <p>Jack would really like...</p> 
   <ul>
    <li>Roller blades</li>
    <li>Magic tricks</li>
    <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
    <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
   </ul>
   <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com"> toysrus.com </a> and <a href="https://www.toyworld.co.nz"> toyworld.co.nz </a>.
